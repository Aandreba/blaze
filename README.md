# Blaze

> **Note**\
> Blaze is still very much unstable and in early development. At this stage, methods and traits may be changed without deprecation period, backwards compatibility isn't guaranteed, and unexpected bugs may arise.

Blaze is a Rust crate that has the goal of **rustifying** and **simplifying** as much as possible the OpenCL experience.

This goal is achieved with the introduction of various abstractions, most of them with syntax simillar to a Rust counterpart.
